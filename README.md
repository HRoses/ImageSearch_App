# Image Search App

This is an image search app made with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. 

This app is built using **UnsplashAPI** and the Javascript **FetchAPI** leveraging **DOM Maniputation** and CSS styles.

**Disclaimer**: 
This was accomplished using a youtube tutorial. I have personalized it to show my understanding of the material.
